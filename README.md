👋 Hi, I’m Muhammad Faran Ullah Khan (@1faran-khandev)

I’m a self-taught developer focused on building modern web applications and growing into backend and full-stack engineering. I enjoy solving real problems with clean code, APIs, and scalable system design.

Recently, I successfully completed the **HENNGE International Backend Coding Challenge (2026)**, implementing recursion-based computation, secure TOTP authentication (HMAC-SHA512), and authenticated API communication in Python.
